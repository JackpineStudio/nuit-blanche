## Nuit Blanche

Node.js + Three.js + Twitter realtime visualization created for Nuit Blanche Ottawa, ON.

Created in collaboration with [@jackpine](https://twitter.com/JackpineCo) and [@taulantsulko](https://twitter.com/TaulantSulko)

See it in action (hopefully) [here](http://rmill.ca:8080/) (warning, `#selfie` hashtag is sometimes NSWF)

## Instalation

Clone away, jump into the projects and then:

```
npm install
node app.js
```

You'll have to modify config.js and init.js (depending) to get it working for your enviroment ;)
